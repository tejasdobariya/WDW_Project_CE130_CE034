            <pre><i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>What causes diabetes?</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>The cause of diabetes, regardless of the type, is having too much glucose
      circulating in your bloodstream. However, the reason why your blood glucose
      levels are high differs depending on the type of diabetes.

      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Causes of Type 1 diabetes</u></b>                   :- This is an immune system disease. Your body attacks and destroys
                                                      insulin-producing cells in your pancreas. Without insulin to allow
                                                      glucose to enter your cells, glucose builds up in your bloodstream.
                                                      Genes may also play a role in some patients. Also, a virus may trigger
                                                      the immune system attack.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Cause of Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes</u></b>    :- Your body’s cells don't allow insulin to work as it should to let
                                                      glucose into its cells. Your body's cells have become resistant to insulin.
                                                      Your pancreas can’t keep up and make enough insulin to overcome this resistance.
                                                      Glucose levels rise in your bloodstream.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Gestational diabetes</u></b>                        :- Hormones produced by the placenta during your pregnancy make your
                                                      body’s cells more resistant to insulin. Your pancreas can’t make enough
                                                      insulin to overcome this resistance. Too much glucose remains in your
                                                      bloodstream.</span>

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>What are the symptoms of diabetes?</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Symptoms of diabetes include:

        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Diabetes is diagnosed and managed by checking your glucose level in a blood test. There are three tests that can
        measure your blood glucose level: fasting glucose test, random glucose test and A1c test.
        
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Fasting plasma glucose test</u></b>   :- This test is best done in the morning after an eight hour fast (nothing to eat or drink except sips of water).</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Random plasma glucose test</u></b>    :- This test can be done any time without the need to fast.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>A1c test</u></b>                      :- This test, also called HbA1C or glycated hemoglobin test, provides your average blood glucose level over
                                          the past two to three months. This test measures the amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin, the protein
                                          in your red blood cells that carries oxygen. You don’t need to fast before this test.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Oral glucose tolerance test</u></b>   :- In this test, blood glucose level is first measured after an overnight fast. Then you drink a sugary
                                          drink. Your blood glucose level is then checked at hours one, two and three.</span>

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Who should be tested for diabetes?</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>If you have symptoms or risk factors for diabetes, you should get tested. The
        earlier diabetes is found, the earlier management can begin and complications can be lessened or
        prevented. If a blood test determines you have prediabetes, you and your healthcare professional
        can work together to make lifestyle changes (e.g. weight loss, exercise, healthy diet) to
        prevent or delay developing Type 2 diabetes.

        Additional specific testing advice based on risk factors:

        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Testing for Type 1 diabetes</u></b>    :- Test in children and young adults who have a family history of diabetes. Less commonly, older
                                           adults may also develop Type 1 diabetes. Therefore, testing in adults who come to the hospital
                                           and are found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis is important. Ketoacidosis a dangerous complication
                                           that can occur in people with Type 1 diabetes.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Testing for Type 2 diabetes</u></b>    :- Test adults age 45 or older, those between 19 and 44 who are overweight and have one or more
                                           risk factors, women who have had gestational diabetes, children between 10 and 18 who are overweight
                                           and have at least two risk factors for type 2 diabetes.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Gestational diabetes</u></b>           :- Test all pregnant women who have had a diagnosis of diabetes. Test all pregnant women between
                                           weeks 24 and 28 of their pregnancy. If you have other risk factors for gestational diabetes, your
                                           obstetrician may test you earlier.</span>

        <span style='font-size: 13px;'>&#9702;Quitting smoking (if you smoke).</span>

        You have a lot of control – on a day-to-day basis – in managing your diabetes!

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>How do I check my blood glucose level? Why is this important?</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Checking your blood glucose level is important because the results help guide decisions about what to eat, your physical activity
        and any needed medication and insulin adjustments or additions.

        The most common way to check your blood glucose level is with a blood glucose meter. With this test, you prick the side of your
        finger, apply the drop of blood to a test strip, insert the strip into the meter and the meter will show your glucose level at
        that moment in time. Your healthcare provider will tell you how often you’ll need to check your glucose level.

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>What is continuous glucose monitoring?</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Advancements in technology have given us another way to monitor glucose levels. Continuous glucose monitoring uses a tiny sensor
        inserted under your skin. You don't need to prick your finger. Instead, the sensor measures your glucose and can display results
        anytime during the day or night. Ask your healthcare provider about continuous glucose monitors to see if this is an option for you. 

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>What should my blood glucose level be?</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Ask your healthcare team what your blood glucose level should be. They may have a specific target range for you. In general, though,
        most people try to keep their blood glucose levels at these targets:

        <span style='font-size: 13px;'>&#9702;Before a meal: between 80 and 130 mg/dL.</span>
        <span style='font-size: 13px;'>&#9702;About two hours after the start of a meal: less than 180 mg/dL.</span>

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Are there other treatment options for diabetes?</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Yes. There are two types of transplantations that might be an option for a select number of patients who have Type 1 diabetes. A
        pancreas transplant is possible. However, getting an organ transplant requires taking immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of your
        life and dealing with the side effects of these drugs. However, if the transplant is successful, you’ll likely be able to stop
        taking insulin.

        Another type of transplant is a pancreatic islet transplant. In this transplant, clusters of islet cells (the cells that make
        insulin) are transplanted from an organ donor into your pancreas to replace those that have been destroyed.
        
        Another treatment under research for Type 1 diabetes is immunotherapy. Since Type 1 is an immune system disease, immunotherapy
        holds promise as a way to use medication to turn off the parts of the immune system that cause Type 1 disease.
        
        Bariatric surgery is another treatment option that’s an indirect treatment for diabetes. Bariatric surgery is an option if you
        have Type 2 diabetes, are obese (body mass index over 35) and considered a good candidate for this type of surgery. Much improved
        blood glucose levels are seen in people who have lost a significant amount of weight.
        
        Of course other medications are prescribed to treat any existing health problems that contribute to increasing your risk of
        developing diabetes. These conditions include high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other heart-related diseases.

            <pre><i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Can prediabetes, Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes be prevented?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Although diabetes risk factors like family history and race can’t be changed, there are other risk factors that you do
            have some control over. Adopting some of the healthy lifestyle habits listed below can improve these modifiable risk
            factors and help to decrease your chances of getting diabetes:

            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Eat a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean or Dash diet. Keep a food diary and calorie count of everything you eat.
             Cutting 250 calories per day can help you lose ½ pound per week.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Get physically active. Aim for 30 minutes a day at least five days a week. Start slow and work up to this amount or
             break up these minutes into more doable 10 minute segments. Walking is great exercise.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Lose weight if you are overweight. Don’t lose weight if you are pregnant, but check with your obstetrician about
             healthy weight gain during your pregnancy.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Lower your stress. Learn relaxation techniques, deep breathing exercises, mindful meditation, yoga and other helpful
             strategies.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Limit alcohol intake. Men should drink no more than two alcoholic beverages a day; women should drink no more than one.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Get an adequate amount of sleep (typically 7 to 9 hours).</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Quit smoking.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Take medications – to manage existing risk factors for heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure, cholesterol) or to
             reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes – as directed by your healthcare provider.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;If you think you have symptoms of prediabetes, see your provider.</span>

          
<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Can Type 1 diabetes be prevented?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>No. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, meaning your body attacks itself. Scientists aren’t sure why someone’s body
             would attack itself. Other factors may be involved too, such as genetic changes.

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Can the long-term complications of diabetes be prevented?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Chronic complications are responsible for most illness and death associated with diabetes. Chronic complications usually
            appear after several years of elevated blood sugars (hyperglycemia). Since patients with Type 2 diabetes may have elevated
            blood sugars for several years before being diagnosed, these patients may have signs of complications at the time of diagnosis.

            The complications of diabetes have been described earlier in this article. Although the complications can be wide ranging
            and affect many organ systems, there are many basic principles of prevention that are shared in common. These include:

            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Take your diabetes medications (pills and/or insulin) as prescribed by your doctor.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Take all of your other medications to treat any risk factors (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, other heart-related
             problems and other health conditions) as directed by your doctor.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Monitor your blood sugars closely.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Follow a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean or Dash diet. Do not skip meals.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Exercise regularly, at least 30 minutes five days a week.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Lose weight if you are overweight.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Keep yourself well-hydrated (water is your best choice).</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Quit smoking, if you smoke.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;See your doctor regularly to monitor your diabetes and to watch for complications.</span>

            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>If you have diabetes, the most important thing you can do is keep your blood glucose level within the target range recommended
            by your healthcare provider. In general, these targets are:

            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Before a meal: between 80 and 130 mg/dL.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;About two hours after the start of a meal: less than 180 mg/dL.</span>

            You will need to closely follow a treatment plan, which will likely include following a customized diet plan, exercising 30 minutes
            five times a week, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol and getting seven to nine hours of sleep a night. Always take your medications
            and insulin as instructed by your provider.

            <pre><i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>When should I call my doctor?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>If you haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes, you should see your healthcare provider if you have any symptoms of diabetes.
            If you already have been diagnosed with diabetes, you should contact your provider if your blood glucose levels are outside
            of your target range, if current symptoms worsen or if you develop any new symptoms.

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Does eating sugary foods cause diabetes?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Sugar itself doesn't directly cause diabetes. Eating foods high in sugar content can lead to weight gain, which is a risk
            factor for developing diabetes. Eating more sugar than recommended – American Heart Association recommends no more than six
            teaspoons a day (25 grams) for women and nine teaspoons (36 grams) for men – leads to all kinds of health harms in addition
            to weight gain.

            These health harms are all risk factors for the development of diabetes or can worsen complications. Weight gain can:
            
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Raise blood pressure, cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Cause fat buildup in your liver.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Cause tooth decay.</span>

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>What types of healthcare professionals might be part of my diabetes treatment team?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Most people with diabetes see their primary healthcare provider first. Your provider might refer you to an
            endocrinologist/pediatric endocrinologist, a physician who specializes in diabetes care. Other members of your healthcare
            team may include an ophthalmologist (eye doctor), nephrologist (kidney doctor), cardiologist (heart doctor), podiatrist
            (foot doctor), neurologist (nerve and brain doctor), gastroenterologist (digestive tract doctor), registered dietician,
            nurse practitioners/physician assistants, diabetes educator, pharmacist, personal trainer, social worker, mental health
            professional, transplant team and others.

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>How often do I need to see my primary diabetes healthcare professional?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>In general, if you are being treated with insulin shots, you should see your doctor at least every three to
            four months. If you are treated with pills or are managing diabetes through diet, you should be seen at least every four
            to six months. More frequent visits may be needed if your blood sugar is not controlled or if complications of diabetes
            are worsening.

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Can diabetes kill you?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Yes, it’s possible that if diabetes remains undiagnosed and uncontrolled (severely high or severely low glucose
            levels) it can cause devastating harm to your body. Diabetes can cause heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure
            and coma. These complications can lead to your death. Cardiovascular disease in particular is the leading cause of death
            in adults with diabetes.
