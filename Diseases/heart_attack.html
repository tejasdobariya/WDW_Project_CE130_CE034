            <h3><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#9679;</span>&nbsp;SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES</h3>
            <pre><i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>What causes a heart attack?</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>The vast majority of heart attacks occur because of a blockage in one of the
      blood vessels that supply your heart. This most often happens because of
      plaque, a sticky substance that can build up on the insides of your arteries
      (similar to how pouring grease down your kitchen sink can clog your home plumbing).
      That buildup is called atherosclerosis.

      Sometimes, plaque deposits inside the coronary (heart) arteries can break open or
      rupture, and a blood clot can get stuck where the rupture happened. If the clot 
      blocks the artery, this can deprive the heart muscle of blood and cause a heart attack.
      
      Heart attacks are possible without a blockage, but this is rare and only accounts
      for about 5% of all heart attacks. This kind of heart attack can occur for the
      following reasons:

      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Spasm of the artery</u></b>                              :- Your blood vessels have a muscle lining that allows them to become wider or narrower as needed.
                                                           Those muscles can sometimes twitch or spasm, cutting off blood flow to heart muscle.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Rare medical conditions</u></b>                          :- An example of this would be any disease that causes unusual narrowing of blood vessels.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Trauma</u></b>                                           :- This includes tears or ruptures in the coronary arteries.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Obstruction that came from elsewhere in the body</u></b> :- A blood clot or air bubble (embolism) that gets trapped in a coronary artery.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Electrolyte imbalances</u></b>                           :- Having too much or too little of key minerals like potassium in your blood can cause a
                                                           heart attack.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Eating disorders</u></b>                                 :- Over time, an eating disorder can cause damage to your heart and ultimately result in a
                                                           heart attack.</span><br>
<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Who is most at risk for a heart attack?</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Several key factors affect your risk of having a heart attack.
      Unfortunately, some of these risk factors aren't things you can control.

      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Age and sex.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Family history of heart disease.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;History of preeclampsia, a condition that can develop during pregnancy.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Lifestyle.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;If you have certain health conditions or diseases.</span>

<i class="fa fa-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Age and sex.</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Your risk of heart attack increases as you get older, and your sex
      also influences when your risk of a heart attack starts to increase:

      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Men: The risk of heart attack increases greatly at age 45.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Women: The risk of heart attack increases greatly at age 50 or after menopause.</span>

<i class="fa fa-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Family history of heart disease.</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>If you have a parent or sibling with a history of heart disease or heart attack — 
      especially at a younger age — your risk is even greater. That risk increases with
      the following:

      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Your father or a brother who was diagnosed with heart disease at age 55 or younger.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Your mother or a sister who was diagnosed with heart disease at age 65 or younger.</span>
      
<i class="fa fa-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Lifestyle</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>The lifestyle choices you make can also affect your risk of having a heart attack.
      The following lifestyle factors increase your risk of heart attack:

      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Lack of physical activity.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;A diet high in sodium, sugar and fat.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Smoking or tobacco use (including smokeless or chewing tobacco and vaping).</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Drinking too much alcohol.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Drug abuse (especially in younger individuals).</span>

<i class="fa fa-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Other diseases and health conditions</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>The following health conditions can increase your risk of heart attack:

      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Diabetes.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Obesity.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;High blood pressure (hypertension).</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia).</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Eating disorders (especially in younger individuals).</span>

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>What are the symptoms of a heart attack?</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Heart attacks can have a number of symptoms, some of which are more
      common than others. The symptoms you have are also influenced by your sex
      ,as with men and women being more likely to have different heart attack symptoms.

<i class="fa fa-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Common heart attack symptoms</b></i><br>
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Symptoms most often described by people having a heart attack:

      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Chest pain (angina). This symptom can be mild and feel like discomfort or
       heaviness, or it can be severe and feel like crushing pain. It may start in your
       chest and spread (or radiate) to other areas like your left arm (or both arms),
       shoulder, neck, jaw, back or down toward your waist.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Nausea or stomach discomfort. Heart attacks can often be mistaken for indigestion.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Heart palpitations.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Anxiety or a feeling of “impending doom.”</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Sweating.</span>
      <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Feeling lightheaded, dizzy or passing out.</span>

            <pre><i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>How are heart attacks diagnosed?</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Heart attacks are usually diagnosed in an emergency room setting. 
        A healthcare provider will diagnose a heart attack using the following:
        
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>History and symptoms</u></b>            :- The provider will ask you about the symptoms you
                                            experienced. If someone was with you, the provider might also ask them to 
                                            describe what happened.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Lab testing</u></b>                     :- Heart attacks cause a specific chemical marker to show up in
                                            your blood.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Heart-specific diagnostic tests</u></b> :- This includes tests that detect and record
                                            the electrical activity in your heart.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Imaging tests</u></b>                   :- These tests give providers a way to “see” inside your heart.
                                            Many of these tests can also show the location of a blood flow blockage,
                                            which can guide treatment.</span>

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>What tests will be done to diagnose this condition?</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Anyone with heart attack symptoms should undergo a physical examination,
        including checking pulse, blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, and listening to
        heart and lung sounds.

        Other tests used to diagnose heart attack include:
        
        <b>Electrocardiogram (abbreviated as EKG or ECG):</b> This is one of the first tests done
        when someone comes to an ER with heart attack symptoms. This test uses sensors called
        electrodes that attach to the skin of your chest. The electrodes pick up electrical
        activity in the heart and show it as a wave on a display or printout. By looking at
        the wave, providers can see the strength and timing of the electrical signal as it
        travels through your heart. When the signal doesn’t travel like it should, the shape
        of the wave changes, which can indicate a heart attack or similar problems. EKG for
        a heart attack is usually continuous to monitor for changes in heart activity.

        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>STEMI and non-STEMI heart attacks

        The wave of your heart's electrical signal is divided into sections using letters of
        the alphabet starting at P and ending at U. One particular section of the wave, the ST
        segment, shows activity in the heart's lower two chambers. Those chambers are the left
        ventricle and right ventricle.

        Normally, the ST segment is very flat, but a heart attack that affects the ventricles
        will often cause the ST segment to be much taller than normal. Healthcare professionals
        call this kind of heart attack an ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction, or STEMI. Heart
        attacks, in general, are broadly split into STEMI and non-STEMI categories, with STEMI
        heart attacks typically being more severe.

        Blood tests. During a heart attack, the damage to heart muscle cells almost always
        causes a chemical marker to appear in your bloodstream. Blood tests that look for
        that marker are among the most reliable methods to diagnose a heart attack.

        Certain kinds of tests can provide pictures or computer-generated images of the heart.
        These include:

        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Echocardiogram</u></b>                      :- This test uses ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves), similar to how
                                                bats use ultrasound like a sonar to see obstacles. The ultrasonic waves will travel
                                                through and bounce off different parts of your heart at different speeds. An
                                                echocardiogram can use that information to generate a picture of the inside
                                                and outside of your heart.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Angiogram</u></b>                           :- This test involves taking an X-ray after injecting a dye-like substance easily
                                                seen on an X-ray into your blood. This allows doctors to see areas with little
                                                or no blood flow.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Heart computed tomography (CT) scan</u></b> :- This imaging test uses X-rays and computer processing
                                                to create a highly detailed scan of your heart.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Heart MRI</u></b>                           :- This test uses a powerful magnetic field and computer processing to create an image of your heart.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Nuclear heart scans</u></b>                 :- Similar to angiography, these scans use a radioactive dye injected into
                                                your blood. What sets them apart from an angiogram is that they use computer-enhanced
                                                methods like computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans</span>

            <h3><span style='font-size:50px;'>&#9679;</span>&nbsp;MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT</h3>
            <pre><i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>How are heart attacks treated?</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Treating a heart attack means restoring blood flow to the affected heart muscle
        as soon as possible. This can happen in a variety of ways, ranging from
        medication to surgery. It's extremely likely that treatment will use several of the
        following methods.<br>
<i class="fa fa-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Supplementary oxygen</b></i><br>
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>People having trouble breathing or with low blood oxygen levels will often
        receive supplementary oxygen along with other heart attack treatments. You
        can breathe the oxygen either through a tube that sits just below your nose or a
        mask that fits over your nose and mouth. This increases the amount of oxygen
        circulating in the blood and reduces the strain on your heart.

<i class="fa fa-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Medications</b></i><br>
    
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Anti-clotting medications</u></b>               :- This includes aspirin and other blood-thinning
                                                    medicines.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Nitroglycerin</u></b>                           :- This medicine is used to relieve chest pain. It also is a powerful
                                                    vasodilator, meaning it causes blood vessels to widen so blood can pass
                                                    through more easily.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Thrombolytic (clot-busting) medications</u></b> :- These intravenous (IV)
                                                    medications cause blood clots to break down and dissolve. These
                                                    medications are usually used only within the first 12 hours after a
                                                    heart attack.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Anti-arrhythmia medications</u></b>             :- Heart attacks can often cause malfunctions in
                                                    your heart’s normal beating rhythm called arrhythmias. Some arrhythmias
                                                    can be life-threatening. Anti-arrhythmia medications can stop or prevent
                                                    these malfunctions.</span>
        <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Pain medications</u></b>                        :- The most common pain medication given during heart
                                                    attack care is morphine. This can help alleviate chest pain.</span>

<i class="fa fa-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Percutaneous coronary intervention</b></i>

              Restoring circulation to the affected heart muscle is usually done with a
              procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention. Often called PCI for
              short, this procedure uses a catheter-based device inserted into a major
              blood vessel (usually one near your upper thigh).

              Once the catheter is inserted into the blood vessel through a small incision,
              the provider threads it up to the blocked artery on your heart. Once it reaches
              the location of the blockage, the provider will inflate a small balloon on the
              end of the device to widen the blood vessel and clear the blockage.

              PCI is a critical tool in restoring blood flow, and the sooner that happens,
              the better the chance of a good outcome. Hospitals use a metric called
              “door-to-balloon time” to measure their ability to treat a heart attack.
              This is the average time it takes for patients to undergo PCI after they
              first come into the Emergency Room.

              PCI often includes the placement of a stent at the site of the blockage.
              Stents are made of metallic mesh and look like tube-shaped scaffolds. They
              help hold the artery open so another blockage doesn’t happen in the same
              spot. Some stents are coated with a medication that prevents clotting or
              tissue growth on the stent itself (either of which could cause another
              blockage).<br>

            <pre><i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>Can I prevent having a heart attack?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>In general, there are many things that you can do that may prevent a heart
            attack. However, some factors beyond your control — especially your family
            history — can still lead to a heart attack despite your best efforts. Still, reducing
            your risk can postpone when you have a heart attack and reduce the severity if you have one.

<i class="fa fa-question-circle" style="font-size:22px"><b>How can I reduce my risk of having a heart attack?</b></i><br>
            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>Although there are several risk factors that you can’t control, there are many
            ways you can help yourself and reduce your risk of a heart attack.
            These include:
      
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Schedule a checkup: Find a primary care provider and see them at least once
                                 a year for a checkup or wellness visit. An annual checkup can catch many
                                 of the early warning signs of heart disease, including signs that you can't 
                                 feel. These include your blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol
                                 levels and more.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Quit tobacco products</u></b>                  :- This includes smokeless tobacco and all vaping products.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Exercise regularly</u></b>                     :- Aim for 20 to 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity a week.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Eat a healthy diet</u></b>                     :- Examples include the Mediterranean or Dash diets. A plant-based diet approach is an excellent
                                                       alternative.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Maintain a healthy weight</u></b>              :- Your primary care provider can advise you on a healthy goal weight and provide 
                                                       you resources and guidance to help you reach that goal.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Manage your existing health conditions</u></b> :- This includes high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Reduce your stress</u></b>                     :- Consider techniques such as yoga, deep breathing and meditation.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Take your medications</u></b>                  :- Don’t just take medications when you remember to or when you have a doctor’s appointment coming up.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Keep all your medical appointments</u></b>     :- Seeing your healthcare providers regularly can help uncover heart-related issues or 
                                                       other medical problems you didn't know you had. This can also help treat problems sooner
                                                       rather than later.</span>

            Being an active contributor to your health doesn't mean you have to make
            lifestyle changes all on your own. Ask your primary care provider and other
            providers on your healthcare team for help. They can provide the information
            and resources you need, and point you to services from which you might benefit.

            If you've already had a heart attack, your healthcare provider will recommend
            a cardiac rehabilitation program. This program's goals are to reduce your chance
            of a second heart attack. These medically supervised programs provide counseling
            and focus on the same healthy living goals listed above.

            <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="font-size:18px"></i>After you've had a heart attack, you're at a higher risk of a similar occurrence. Your
            healthcare provider will likely recommend follow-up monitoring, testing and care to avoid
            future heart attacks. Some of these include:

            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Heart scans</u></b>            :- Similar to the methods used to diagnose a heart attack, these can assess
                                       the effects of your heart attack and determine if you have permanent heart
                                       damage. They can also look for signs of heart and circulatory problems that
                                       increase the chance of future heart attacks.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Stress test</u></b>            :- Your provider may also recommend that you undergo a stress test. These are
                                       heart tests and scans that take place while you’re exercising. Stress tests
                                       can show potential problems that stand out only when your heart is working
                                       harder.</span>
            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;<b><u>Cardiac rehabilitation</u></b> :- Your healthcare provider may recommend that you go through a cardiac
                                       rehabilitation program during your recovery from a heart attack. These programs
                                       are medically supervised and focus on helping you improve your overall health
                                       and lifestyle, which can prevent another heart attack. Cardiac rehabilitation
                                       generally involves a team of providers and experts, including doctors, physical
                                       therapists, nurses, exercise specialists/trainers, dietitians, health educators,
                                       counselors and more.</span>

            <span style='font-size:13px;'>&#9702;Women between the ages of 45 and 65 who've had a heart attack are more likely to die within a year
